integral.c is all done, but we want to practice compiling it without a Makefile for help.

1. Try to compile: What's wrong?

gcc integral.c -o integral

2. Try again with the math library.

gcc integral.c -lm -o integral

3. Try again with a different C compiler. They mostly all take the same arguments.

clang integral.c -lm -o integral

4. Now run it.

./integral


5. Some of that didn't work. I might have left off the '-o integral'.

If you don't name your program, C will name it 'a.out' for you. Try it:

gcc integral.c -lm
./a.out
